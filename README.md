# My-Portfolio
The purpose of this project was to develop a website that acts as an online portfolio.
In doing making the portfolio, it was necessary to consider things that employers search
for such as an up to date photo and having one's name prominently displayed. In addition,
the header had to be designed to navigate the page, and the work showcase section also
needed to be designed to display future and current projects with the first item being
larger than the other items. The final aspect of consideration was to make the webpage
responsive to different screen sizes.
